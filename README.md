phpZenfolio is a simple object orientated wrapper for the [Zenfolio API](http://www.zenfolio.com/zf/tools/api.aspx), written in PHP.

The intention of this class is to allow PHP application developers quick and easy interaction with the Zenfolio API, without having to worry about the finer details of the API.

Not already a Zenfolio user? Here, have a **$5 discount** off your first year on me by [registering](https://www.zenfolio.com/?refcode=4Y5-2ZY-2A8) using this code:

The development of phpZenfolio takes place in my free time. If you find phpZenfolio useful and found it has saved you a lot of time, I'd really appreciate it if you bought me a coffee or two.

**Note: phpZenfolio 2.0.0 and later is not backwardly compatible with earlier releases.**

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.6.0,
* [Guzzle 6](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) library,
* (optional) [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/), [php-coveralls](https://github.com/php-coveralls/php-coveralls) and [php-cs-fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/) to run tests.

## Installation

The recommended method of installing phpZenfolio is using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org). If you have Composer installed, you can install phpZenfolio and all its dependencies from within your project directory:

    $ composer require lildude/phpzenfolio

Alternatively, you can add the following to your project's `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "lildude/phpzenfolio": "^2.0"
    }
}
```

.. and then run `composer update` from within your project directory.

If you don't have Composer installed, you can download it using:

    $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

## Basic Usage of the phpZenfolio Client

`phpZenfolio` follows the PSR-1, PSR-2 and PSR-4 conventions, which means you can easily use Composer's [autoloading](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading) to integrate `phpZenfolio` into your projects.

```php
<?php
// This file is generated by Composer
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new phpZenfolio\Client('My Cool App/1.0 (http://app.com)'));
$photoset = $client->LoadPhotoSet(12345, 'Level1');
```

From the `$client` object, you have access to all the [Zenfolio API methods](http://www.zenfolio.com/zf/help/api/ref/methods).

## Documentation

See the [`docs` directory](docs/) or <http://phpzenfolio.com> for more detailed documentation.

## Examples

phpZenfolio comes with four examples to help get you on your way.

* [`example-login.php`](examples/example-login.php) illustrates how to login and display the images in your first photoset or collection.
* [`example-user.php`](examples/example-user.php) illustrates how to display the first 96 public photos of the specified user's first public photoset found.
