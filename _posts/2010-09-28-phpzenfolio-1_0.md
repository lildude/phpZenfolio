phpZenfolio 1.0 is now available for download.

This is the very first release so there may be a few rough edges. That said, I have conducted a fair amount of testing on the code with near 100% code coverage in my unit tests and I don't believe there are any problems as it stands.

So head on over to the download page, get downloading and start tinkering and building your own applications.

The download comes with 3 easy to follow examples to help get in on your way along with an extensive README which is identical to the Documentation page.

Oh and if you want some free advertising, drop me a line and I'll add a link and brief description to the sidebar of this site so others can see too.

If you encounter an problems or have queries, please feel free to ask.
