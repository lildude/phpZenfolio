Need a quick bit of help, have a quick question, want to show off your app using phpZenfolio or just want to say thanks for phpZenfolio? Please feel free to do so on Twitter using the #phpZenfolio hash tag. There's a button on the sidebar too to help you :smile:

Provided I'm not on holiday, I'll normally respond, if necessary within a couple of hours of your tweet - normally minutes if during UK business hours :smile:
