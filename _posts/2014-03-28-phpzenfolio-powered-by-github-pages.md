It's been a long time coming, but as part of migrating all of my hosting to Digital Ocean, I've decided to move the hosting of phpZenfolio.com onto [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).  This moves the entire site closer to the source code and keeps everything in one place.

Unfortunately, it does mean I've had to remove the Examples page which you could have used for testing.  Fear not though, the examples are still included in the source code.
