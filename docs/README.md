# phpZenfolio Documentation

## Overview

phpZenfolio is a simple object orientated wrapper for the Zenfolio API, written in PHP.

The intention of this class is to allow PHP application developers quick and easy interaction with the Zenfolio API, without having to worry about the finer details of the API.

Not already a Zenfolio user? Here, have a **$5 discount** off your first year on me by [registering](https://www.zenfolio.com/?refcode=4Y5-2ZY-2A8) using this code: **[4Y5-2ZY-2A8](https://www.zenfolio.com/?refcode=4Y5-2ZY-2A8)**

The development of phpZenfolio takes place in my free time. If you find phpZenfolio useful and found it has saved you a lot of time, Iâ€™d really appreciate it if you bought me a coffee or two.
