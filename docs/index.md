# Overview

phpZenfolio is a PHP wrapper class for the [Zenfolio API](https://www.zenfolio.com/zf/tools/api.aspx). The intention of this class is to allow PHP application developers to quickly and easily interact with the Zenfolio API in their applications, without having to worry about the finer details of the API.

Not already a Zenfolio user? Here, have a **$5 discount** off your first year on me by [registering](https://www.zenfolio.com/?refcode=4Y5-2ZY-2A8) using this code:

  [4Y5-2ZY-2A8](https://www.zenfolio.com/?refcode=4Y5-2ZY-2A8){:.btn .btn-success .text-center}

The development of phpZenfolio takes place in my free time. If you find phpZenfolio useful and found it has saved you a lot of time, I'd really appreciate it if you bought me a coffee or two.
