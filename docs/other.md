## Caching API Responses

Caching has been removed from phpZenfolio as the headers in the Zenfolio API responses discourage caching and now phpZenfolio is using Guzzle, you can take advantage of much better Guzzle-friendly middleware implementations, like [guzzle-cache-middleware](https://github.com/Kevinrob/guzzle-cache-middleware), that better tie-in with the various frameworks you may already be using.

In order to use one of these middleware caching mechanisms, you'll need to [create and pass a handler stack](https://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/handlers-and-middleware.html) with the cache middleware you plan to use when instantiating the phpZenfolio client. For example:

```php
<?php
$handler_stack = HandlerStack::create();
$handler_stack->push(new YourChosenCachingMiddleware(), 'cache');
$client = new phpZenfolio\Client('My Cool App/1.0 (https://app.com)', ['handler' => $handler_stack]);
```

Keeps in mind that phpZenfolio uses POST to the same URL for all requests.  You may need to take this into account when configuring your caching implementation.

Please refer to your chosen caching implementation documentation for further details on how to use and implement that side of things with Guzzle.


## Access Zenfolio via a Proxy

Accessing Zenfolio with phpZenfolio through a proxy is possible by passing the `proxy` option when instantiating the client:

```php
<?php
$client = new phpZenfolio\Client('My Cool App/1.0 (https://app.com)', ['proxy' => 'https://[PROXY_ADDRESS]:[PORT]']));
```

All your requests will pass through the specified proxy on the specified port.

If you need a username and password to access your proxy, you can include them in the URL in the form: `https://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@[PROXY_ADDRESS]:[PORT]`.


## Image URLs Helper

To make it easy to obtain the direct URL to an image, phpZenfolio supplies an `imageURL()` method that takes the Photo object as returned by methods like `LoadPhoto()` and `LoadPhotoSetPhotos()` and an integer for the desired photo size where the integer is one of those documented at <https://www.zenfolio.com/zf/help/api/guide/download>.

For example:

```php
<?php
$client = new phpZenfolio\Client('My Cool App/1.0 (https://app.com)');
$photos = $client->LoadPhotoSetPhotos([PHOTOSETID], [STARTINGINDEX], [NUMBEROFPHOTOS]);
foreach ($photos as $photo) {
    echo '<img src="'.phpZenfolio\Client::imageUrl($photo, 1).'" />';
}
```


## Examples

phpZenfolio comes with four examples to help get you on your way.

* `example-popular.php` illustrates how to obtain the 96 most popular galleries and display their title image linking to each individual gallery.
* `example-login.php` illustrates how to login and display the images in your first photoset or collection.
* `example-user.php` illustrates how to display the first 96 public photos of the specified user's first public photoset found.
* `example-create-photoset.php` illustrates how to create a new gallery photoset in the authenticated user's root photoset group, and upload an image to this gallery.
